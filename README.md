# Vending-samples
Vending machine code samples

This module encapsulates all functions related to the physical dispensing of
 the K-cup, sensing the state of the Dispense and Cancel buttons, and sensing
 the state of the Carousel Index sensor.  This includes operation of the stepper
 motor though the dispense cycle as well as the detection of any errors that
 may occur during such operation.  It provides a programming interface to
 initiate dispensing, and generates all events associated with proper motor
 operation and sensor state.  This module also provides a programming
 interface to retrieve any error codes that are generated by its function.
