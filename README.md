Vending machine code samples

Included code samples illustrates the operation and control of vending hardware. 
 - Dispense Manager module : encapsulates all functions related to the physical dispensing of
 a product, sensing the state of the Dispense and Cancel buttons, and sensing
 the state of the product selector.  This includes operation of the stepper
 motor though the dispense cycle as well as the detection of any errors that
 may occur during such operation.  It provides a programming interface to
 initiate dispensing, and generates all events associated with proper motor
 operation and sensor state.  This module also provides a programming
 interface to retrieve any error codes that are generated by its function.
